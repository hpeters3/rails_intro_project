<h1>About Page</h1>
<p>For the Rails Intro Project, the API I decided to use was a Zelda API found at “https://zelda.fanapis.com/api/”. This API contains updated data from all games in the Zelda franchise. It has several endpoints: games, staff, characters, monsters, bosses, dungeons, places, and items. For this assignment, I’ve chosen to use five to meet minimum row  requirements—games, characters, places, monsters and bosses. Data can be searched for by category, like “https://zelda.fanapis.com/api/games/” or by specific ids, like “https://zelda.fanapis.com/api/games/5f6ce9d805615a85623ec2c0”. The data is structured in a typical JSON format. To use the endpoints I have chosen, I will need a Games, Characters, Places, Monsters, and Bosses table. Within the Games table I’ll have id, name, description, developer, publisher, and released date. Inside Characters I’ll have the id, a foreign key for the Games table, name, description, gender, and race. For Places I’ll have id, a foreign key for Games, a foreign key for Characters, name, and description. For Monsters I’ll have the id, foreign key for games, name, and description. The Bosses table will have the same columns. Both places and characters need to exist inside a game, and a game needs characters and places to be enjoyed. Similarly, characters exist in places and places have characters within them, although that is an option association. Games have many monsters and monsters belong in many games, however bosses only appear in one game, and games have many bosses. Enjoy using this interface to explore the Zelda API.</p>
